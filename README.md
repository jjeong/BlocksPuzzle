# BlocksPuzzle
# This project takes a puzzle composed of blocks of different sizes.
# The goal is to have the puzzle match our desired outcome.
# The main solver program (Solver.java) takes an initial.txt and goal.txt as an input
# then maps out the steps taken to reach the given goal.

# Note:
# The two numbers on the first line of initial.txt describe the dimension of the puzzle board.
# The four numbers on each of the subsequent lines describe the size of the block (length width),
# and its location (row col) in respective order.
